The experimental results, based on two real clinical datasets, indicate that although GPT-4 shows promise for future advancements in dementia diagnosis, it currently does not surpass the performance of traditional AI tools. Additionally, the paper evaluates the interpretability and faithfulness of GPT-4 by comparing its outputs with real doctors' assessments. The authors discuss the limitations of GPT-4 in its current state and propose future research directions to enhance its capabilities in dementia diagnosis.\n",
