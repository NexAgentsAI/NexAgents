    "- **ToolCallResultMessage**: Contains results from tool calls.\n",

These are used for interacting with LLM models such as OpenAI's GPT-4: **UserMessage**, which represents a message from a user; **SystemMessage**, which represents a system-generated message; and **AssistantMessage**, which represents a message from an assistant.\n"
