# AutoGen

AutoGen is an open-source framework for building AI agent systems.
It simplifies the creation of event-driven, distributed, scalable, and resilient agentic applications.
It allows you to quickly build systems where AI agents collaborate and perform tasks autonomously
or with human oversight.

- [Key Features](#key-features)
- [Detailed Documentation](#detailed-documentation)

AutoGen streamlines AI development and research, enabling the use of multiple large language models (LLMs), integrated tools, and advanced multi-agent design patterns. You can develop and test your agent systems locally, then deploy to a distributed cloud environment as your needs grow.

## Key Features

AutoGen offers the following key features:

- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Agents communicate via asynchronous messages, supporting both event-driven and request/response interaction patterns.
- **Full type support**: use types in all interfaces and enforced type check on build, with a focus on quality and cohesiveness
- **Scalable & Distributed**: Design complex, distributed agent networks that can operate across organizational boundaries.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Customize your system with pluggable components: custom agents, tools, memory, and models.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Interoperate agents across different programming languages. Currently supports Python and .NET, with more languages coming soon.
- **Observability & Debugging**: Built-in features and tools for tracking, tracing, and debugging agent interactions and workflows, including support for industry standard observability with OpenTelemetry
